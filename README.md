TPX-Impact

Task One:
The HTML and CSS file should be able to be fun up together to show the replicated poster. I have included the chosen poster in the repository.

Task Two:
Inside of the ATM folder, you will find the solution for the ATM task. If I had more time I would have loved to develop this further by linking the app to a database and implementing the overdraft logic. I will continue to work on this code further, implementing the features I have run out of time to write, using this as futher practise for myself. The code should run without any changes or further setup.

The account number and pins are inside the code but I will list the availble combinations below:

Account numbers: 
1 - 12345678
2 - 87654321
3 - 99887766
4 - 54321987
5 - 76908721
6 - 60908321

Pins:
